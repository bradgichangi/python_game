### Welcome to the Thunderdome

## The Rules
    - Each player starts with 100 stamina and 100 health 
    - In turns, each player will decide if they want to attack or block
    - Then will then decide if they want to do that high or low
    - Depending on the decision of each player, the outcome will vary
    - Each turn following the first turn, players will receive 10 stamina

## The Outcomes
    - A high attack requires 30 stamina
    - A low attack requires 15 stamina
    - An unblocked high attack takes 30 health away from the other player
    - An unblocked low attack takes 15 health away from the other player
    - If an attack is blocked, the attacker loses a further 20 stamina and the blocker gains 10 stamina

    - If both choose to attack high they both lose 10 health
    - If both choose to attack low they both lose 5 health

    Remember! Attacking always consumes stamina, and you will run out if you continue to attack. Consider blocking to gain stamina on a successful block as well as the 10 stamina received per turn
